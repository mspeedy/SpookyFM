I need more coffee
Sup, Carl?
How's the weather?
Nothing like the graveyard shift
Do people really like this song?
I must be seeing things
I hate this song
When does my shift end?
Hi, Sarah
Don't you just love unpaid overtime?
How'd you get in here?
You're new
I'm too tired for this
Why me?
Long time, no see
I bet Twitch is loving this
How long have I even been here?
Excuse me, coming through
